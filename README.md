# Replication data and code for MDG/TDG

This repository includes the data and code to replicate the analysis done in "Individuals of high socioeconomic status are altruistic in sharing money but egoistic in sharing time" in Stata. Plots were created using Stata and R. 

The dataset already includes all variables constructed as part of the data preparation, but the construction can be repeated with the corresponding files. Small differences can occur due to the random element when imputing missing data. 

In case of questions, please get in touch with the authors.
